      <description>Consider Phlebas, like most of Banks&amp;rsquo;s early SF output, was a rewritten version of an earlier book, as he explained in a 1994 interview:
 Phlebas was an old one too; it was written just after The Wasp Factory, in 1984. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that rewriting an old book took much more effort than writing one from scratch, but I had to go back to do right by these things. Now I can go on and start completely new stuff.</description>
